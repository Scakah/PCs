## The Folly of one El Errante

**I** t was a lush day on the plains of Greensprings County, a shallow breeze was carressing its grassen mountainsides, as 3 mysterious strangers appear amidst a circled caravan.

The first of the strangers, an apparent youth betraying depths inside, grabs the hoop a playing kid had rolled beside him;
"Here [Handing it back]. Can you tale us to someone i charge?" The kid, momenterally taken aback, nods enthusiatically: "Sure" they say, dragging [Rionnal, the Winter Storm]() along to a gaudy cart, embellished with _coloured_ linen as to stand out from the other colourless wagons.
Meanwhile, the Mysterious [>>Cyriaque<<]() starts making his rounds among the Wagons, thinking to himself that despite being told there'd be an incospicous wagon, the dyed wagon seems to stand out quite a bit. 
Finallly, El Errante, following Rionnal to the man in Charge, manages to become his patronee, finelly embossing his Tabard with the companies logo.

With Cyriaque on one of the spare horses, Rionnal sitting on one of the carts in the middle and El Errante upfront with the Family Head, all of them watching intently for incoming attacks, Rionnal blesses some of the Winds with his blood, calling on them to recede lest they find attackers about to approach.

The Caravan then reaches a sole cart, all 4 of its wheels dispersed to nothing more than a pile of sawdust from what they should be, the Caravan takes on that carts passengers and cargo, a solitary crate of cured hams. Despite the strangers notions, neither the Crate nor the Wagon seemed to be anything more than the appeared to be.

Travelling farther down the road, the eery windstillness created by Rionnal earlier slowly faded as the whistled into his ear.

A group of Dastardly Highroadmen had appaeared on the Horizon, coming down the Mountainous slope. All dressed in garish patchwork clothing, no two of them holding the same weapon, just two of them on Horseback and a few hounds out front.

Rionnal and Cyriaque immediately position themselseves on a ledge, as El Errante comes charging in on another spare horse,
Followed by Rionnal getting a Running start and Cyriaque, following behind.

El Errante, taking a Chug of the Consecrated Tequila, proclaimed he would take care of all the Vagabonds, as he veers of the Rider he had been charging and into the crowd. 

Rionnal, who had taken flight prior to attack him then assailt the incapable cavalrist from above, and both of them tumble down the mountainside.

Cyriaque, catching up, decides to stsrt blasting, as his opponents fumble their patchwork weapons in various ways, only to be rewarded with the pack of hungry hounds gunning for this tasty mutton treat.

Meanwhile, El Errante decides that this dastardly group of vagabonds was too much trouble to face individually pointing out how they began to merge into a big amalgam of themselves.

Cyriaque and Rionnal then witness the horrofic transformation, as the vagabonds turn into a heterogenous mess of their previous form, only for el errante to charge, jump and gun his lance into the monster.

As the watch El Errante be engulfed by the mess, Cyariaque blasts his coach gun into it, sending chuncks and spray everywhere. Rionnal loads his very own coachgun with fulgurites and Buckshot, Running towards the thing.

Cyriaque then follows with a 2 Dragonfire rounds, melting holes into the unholy abomination, followed by a flash of bright light sent out by el errantes aureole illuminating the innards of the thing and halting its advance, as Rionnal places the thunderer on it and fires.

This disperses the upper half of the being, leaving el Errante with his lower half stuck in it. So he gets himself a tasty chunk, bytes into it and subsumes both the things hunger amd fleshmorphing properties, to finally disperse it into a thin mist and spread it amongst the seven winds, that then calm down with no apparant threat around.

The Caravan then resumes, El Errante enjoying a celebratory ham, as the Caravan finally reaches Greenspring, where its and El Errantes newfound prestige gets them past the customs inspection and inside, completing their mission.
