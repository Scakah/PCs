## Background

--- Report --- 

After the death of former corporal Gideon Sulpe (sometimes referred to as Gideon of Sulph) a charge of People was transferred into our custody.
All of them seemed to be subject to horrible experimentation; However, neither Sulpes documentation nor Specialist Zuse seem willing to answer how, or more pressingly why these were done.

This specific one appears almoust decievingly human, but Scans show a horrific amount of from appearances useless machinery underneath the Skin and outer fat layer.
Both officer kane and specialist zuse assure me that while their modifications are potent, 
they do not pose any immediate threat to themselves or their sorroundings.

From my personal interactions, they seem detached from the World as a whole - but are willing to do as their told.

After a brief psychological evaluation by High Shepard Macentyre, i was told to set them up with some tasks for now, 
for which the enclave seems a good place.
