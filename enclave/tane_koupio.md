## Background

During his journeys helping out several far-reaching orbulan colonies, [Dave](../dave_Macentyre.md) happened upon a small congregation of travelling "Aliens", among them a young Tāne.
He joined them for a brief drink that turned into a small feast, at the end of which a traditional reading of the future was held.

The contents of the Vision were for the first time not revealed by the elder, instead he just insisted that Tāne should accompany Markus,
who intern trained and edjucated the young man.

On the Day orbulus fell, he had just helped ferry another load of people into a ship when he was grabbed by Markus, and both of them fled on [Georgs](../georg_zuse.md) ship, reconvening briefly with the others on John's Colony, 
before turning themselves to the larger universe in search for means and capabilites to restore what once was.
