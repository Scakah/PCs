## Background

Lucas gorwing up a Servecks had just one goal: to make it big. So when the Commander asked for volunteers among the oars,
almost bare left alone for a thick woolen tunic.

Despite this, he managed to push through and was the only one left alive after a heavy asault where he alongside the other volunteers
managed to assault and take a hydro-power-plant.

As a result, the emperor himself granted him a minor title, along some lands and a manor.
Despite having made it as far as a person of his birth could, he faced to problems:
Wanting more of both the thrill and the spoils.

Thusly, after Leon and Domnius reported to the Gorum that both was to be had with the enclave, he signed up.
