## Background

Every Orbulan remembers the day orbulus was salted.

Before the Fall, he was a decorated prosecutor specialized in anomalies, with his squad comprising [Taylor](./taylor_cane.md) among other individuals

Robert was just about to sentence a Young "Psion", [Horatio](./horatio_ambitiousus.md) alongside his squad, when [Georg](./georg_zuse.md) broke up the group and locked taylor in a Duell - giving the others pause to see the Grey mass that was a once blue planet; They then stopped Taylor alongside Georg, and improvised. Appropriating and begrudingly boarded it with them, landing on [Johns](./John_sinclair.md) Colony.

After the Plan was hatched, he joined Taylor and John at the Enclave, hoping to restore Orbulus alongside them.
