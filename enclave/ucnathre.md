## Backstory

The Cassidians are a species of sentient octopodes nativrme to the 6th Moon of Cassidia VI - A satelite made almost completely of ice with a few pockets of water enclosed within.

As such, the cassidians tend to keep to themselves; The anulans had thought their system to be uninhabited for 120 Years before new sensors managed to detect them, and resulted in the cassidians first outside contacts. 

the newfound certainty of alien life has split Cassidian society, with a majority wishing to stay on the planet and amongst themselves. A scant few wished to venture outside - nat among them.

Though their peaceful exploration was cut short when their local allies, the anulans and orbulus went to war - while the anulans had offered an alliance based on their use of water-based space travel, the orbulans also made diplomatic efforts.

as the upper echelons still believed in isolationism, they opted to stay neutral. 
For Humanitarian Reasons, they did however establish a Refugee and Relief program, into which their few travellers were integrsted immediately.

Nat joined the staff on their orbulan station situated on the worlds singular moon when the salting happened, and tried his best to take on and move as many orbulans as possible.

spending the next 2 years wrecking himself to provide as much aid as possible, he was exiled from his homeworld and workplace, as his superiors wanted him to "take a break".

during his listless travels, he met a Squad of Agents on a mission [which he assisted and got credited for after the fact?], being asked to and joining the enclave after.
