## Background


### Short
John was the last Gouvernor/Commanding Officer of a Space Station turned Colony in an outer Sector of a large intergalactic Entity. When the war came there, it destroyed the place, leaving only John in its wake. Lacking a Place to belong, he decided to Join the Enclave.

### Established facts
- John still knows of/uses money, although he is used to it being fully digitized/abstract

### Full Story

John started his military traiing as a Combat Engineer, serving 3 Years during the Initial War with a group his people called the "Anulans".
During the war, his mind for organizing and using available (Hunan) Resources had earned him a re-training to become a Specialist, still adjoined to the same squad.
During an attack on a Space Station, he managed to barely survive with is squad intact, again by using the Local Staff to great effect.
As "reward" he was promoted to be governour of a small colony that was part of the territory recently ceeded to the enemy during a ciece-fire.
Afterwards, his superiors decided to "reclaim" said territory, horribly loosing while overextending and incurring a terrible counteratttck, leaving all Colonies destroyed, and 
the Homeworld "salted", rendering it uninhabitable and it's resource stockpiles slowly dwindling. 
As response, what remained of the Militrary was split into two groups: Those that would try to evacuate and safeguard what's left, and those that went out in search for solutions of the many problems.

John decided he had enough working with the government, leaving his post for the Enclave, will still on the hunt for solutions to his peoples problems.
