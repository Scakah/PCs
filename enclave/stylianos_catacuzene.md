## Background

The Older brother of [Szeth](szethaelas.md), He was set up to inherit the Families duties, he much like Szeth rather used the family wealth and influence against their Empire.
Unlike Szeth however, he did not do it out of good consience but rather to increase his own wealth and standing,
turning on his allies and contacts on the Day of the Invasion.

When he heard of the Enclave and the Imeasurable Wealth to be gained from missions, he signed up.
