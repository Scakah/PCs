## Appearance

Short (5.4), scrawny man. Skin has a slight green-ish hue, as if sick. Hair is of natural white color, and wildly exploding out of his head. Eyes are a grey-ish blue. Usually wearing a fish-custome-overall.

##  Background

Horatio grew up as the child of a influential FTL engine developer stationed on Phagiea IV.
Ever the contrarian, he'd rather learn of archaic modes of travel like airships, submarines and personnel-cannons, and he started building steam-engines instead of anti-gravity generators.

When the colony was attacked, he was one of the two people saved by [Georg](./georg_zuse.md) alongside [John](./john-sinclair.md) for a purpose the former has yet to reveal to the two.

Currently, Horatio is working on a way to let his people leave their "dying" homeworld with the resources available, and was invited to zhe enclave by John, both to learn and experience the manifold on-mission, as well as to imrpve his odds with the resources of the enclave.
