## Background

As member of the Servecks class of the Anulan Empire, Domnius was brought up to do and tolerate inhuman amounts of hard manual labor.
Serving dutifully as oar on anulan galleys, and later as generator cog on their submarine ships,
he managed to live to the age of 30, at wich point all servecks are granted the honorary title of "civitas colmunam".
Afterwards, he was free to pursue both philosophy and a regular life among the other true anulans.

During one of the Symposiums, he met [Szethaelas](../szethaelas.md) who not only got him to think about the state of his servecks "kinsmen", 
but also introduced him to a way to bring an actual change about - [John](../john-sinclair.md) and his group of orbulan survivors, as well as the Enclave.
