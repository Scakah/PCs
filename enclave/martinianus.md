## Background

Martinianus grow up in the Mercantile environment of what would become the 3rd Anulan Fleet,
Made entirely out of Mercantile Vessels. As such, they managed to evade the Orbulan strike forces for most oft the war;
They finally completed [Leons](./leonzius_phrant.md) to use the Catapultae, enourmous magical mass drivers,
to Bombard Orbulus with salt rocks.

Unbeknownst to him, the Orbulans had themselves landed a critical blow to the Anulan economy, leaving both Governments crippled
and struggling for survival.

To re-gain Anulan favor. The newly ascended Senator Phrant now had penned and enacted a Motion by wich the "Warcriminals" involved in the Salting of Orbulus
were to be tried, and depending on the severity of their actions, executed or sent into forced labor for the Orbulus.

Seeing the writing on the wall, Martinianus snuck on to a Cassidan Ship, bringing him into a Refugee Camp they had set up for the Orbulans,
after which he drifted around before joining the Enclave on a whim.
