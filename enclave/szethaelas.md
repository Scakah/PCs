## Background

### Short

A trained soldier and Diplomat, Szeth was one of the Few Anulans both Wealthy and Important enough to see much of the Manifold before his people started a war with the Orbulans. Trying throughout to broker truces and bring peace, his own failures and the hopelesness of the endevour have rendered him a Cynic - enjoying live despite its apparent Meaninglessness.


### Long

A well known and lauded officer of the Anulan Diplomatic Course, Szeth had many a contacts on both anulus and orbulus before the latter fell. 

A week before the Fated day, he met with [David](../dave.md) and Abraham, trying to prevent the Final Strike agains orbulus. despite dave misgivings, they hatched a plan, sadly fruitless.

After failing to prevent the Day Anulus was salted, Szeth had still a promise to keep - take care of his good friend Abrahams children [Gideon](../gideon.md) and [Ariel](../ariel.md).

Bringing them to his estate on Anulus and declaring them his spoils of the War, he arranged for his Keepers [Athena](../athena.md) and [Leah](../leah.md). The former had been with him since his old childhood, and the latter was another spoil gained of the estate of a friend that died on the strike.

Following the Disgruntled Gideon after he had Disappeared, Szeth met both [John](./john_sinclair.md) and the Enclave, and was Enranchised by them to help with Johns project.
