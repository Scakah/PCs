## Backstory

A Trained Shepherd in the order of the Sun unyielding, Dave spent most of his early career taking travelling between the outer colonies to help them with their troubles, mostly dealing with local fauna.
During this, while not attaining any advancements, he did become a favourite of the People. As the gouvernors became anxious of his popularity, they finally had him advance - ranked up to Captain, he was promoted to a fine posting at... the Academy.
During his time there - he did meet and train [John](./john-sinclair.md), [Gideon](./gideon.md) and [Taylor](./taylor_cane.md).
When the War broke out, he actually managed to Sneak of on the Ship carryin John and his squad - but was quickly found and returned to earth - public relations.
While that worked seemed menial to him at first, he found working with the People quite enjoyable.

When the Anulans finally came to Salt Orbulus, he was on the front lines, prepared for what they (and he) thought was to be an assault.
After helping Evacuate People, he was met by the enigmatic [Georg](./georg_zuse.md) with both of them arguing the future of their kind - Georg needing Great and Terrible to bring him to heel.
He did then accompany Georg, mostly on account of the young [Horatio](./horatio_ambitiousus), bringing him a few steps later to enclave HQ.
