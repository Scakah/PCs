## Backstory

Gideon served 3 Years during a War with the group his people called the "Orbulus".
During the war, his attitude of using whatever means necesary to advance his career while keeping his head had advanced him quickly.
When he was finally promoted to be governour of a small colony that was part of the territory recently ceeded to the enemy during a cease-fire,
Gideon decided to strike a Deal with the Orbulus, offering his colony as a beachhead to them and commiting Treason against his own.
The following years, he lived a live of leasure and Oppulence, joining the Enclave as his small resources were consumed, and the Orbulus replaced him with one of their own.
