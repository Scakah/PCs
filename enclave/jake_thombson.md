## Background

Being born in a town that has long outlived it's golden days,
surrounded by only fields of wheat and corn,
Jake grew up to be a bored teen-ager.
With nothing better to do, he quickly picked up an "apptetite" for the Occult.
While the hobby only led to contact with a few "Witches" in his hometown,
He specifically felt drawn to a Warrior Cult known both for their Explorations and Colonization of their Worlds largest Archipelago, 
but also their Warrior cults.

For his 16th birthday, he could convince his parents to make a trip to the Region the cult had spread to in it's glorious past.
Sadly, that time has long since gone, and the idyllic Island had nothing more than Beach Resorts and Forests.
Begrudgingly exploring those Woods on a hiking trip, he stumbled over the resting place of a Tribal Chieftain, inherinting his Spiritual Energy as well as his vengeful Spirt.
