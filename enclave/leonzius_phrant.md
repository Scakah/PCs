## Background

The front-line commander during the first assaults on orbulus,
Leonzius carved a path deep into the enemy territory,

to install a more lenient commander in his stead.

Driven from his place, he wandered the Universer for a while - 
until [Gideon](./gideon.md) and [Georg](./georg_zuse.md) kidnapped him to drag him to the now salted orbulus.
