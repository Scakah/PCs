## Background

The front-line commander during the first assaults on orbulus,
Leonzius carved a path deep into the enemy territory,
earning himself a name on the battlefield.

However, his rival [Szeth](./szethaelas_catacuzene.md) maneuvered the Senate against him,
to install a more lenient commander in his stead.

Driven from his place, he wandered the Universer for a while - 
until [Gideon](./gideon.md) and [Georg](./georg_zuse.md) kidnapped him to drag him to the now salted orbulus.

With a renewed sense of Purpose, he joined the Orbulus restoration Council,
and does Enclave missions on Occasion to help with its projects.

## Appearance

Tall barrel-chested man with white hair, flowy purple toga formed into shape by the sash;
