## Background
 Every Orbulan remembers the day orbulus was salted. 

Marcus had been a youth with way more energy than a young man knew what to do with, and always enjoyed being on his feet, 
so when he had to pick a job, he wanted to join the Technical Emergency Services. This would lead him to become a sapper in [Johns](./john-sinclair.md) squad during the war,
and also for him to become the operations head of Johns colony when the time came.
  
 Marcus had just helped a few of Johns Colonists to plow a field when they hurriedly headed to the small screen on the Farmhouse;
 There, news-reports of the Attrocious attack were running. Marcus, watching them, got an ominous feeling of things to come.

 The next day, he was instructed by John to prepare for a big wave of incoming refugees.
 The man he had come to trust and understand had been forced to accept as many refugees as the central government determined could fit on the planet - 
 a severe strain in the resources and production capabilities of this far-flung world.

 Nevertheless, Marcus (and John) threw themselves at the Task, getting a good 70% of the required supplies ready -
 some rationing, and they could endure the first few days.

 Then, the fated day: Waiting on the landing Platform with John and the others, he got to witness a terrifyingly beautiful image -
 The fleet of refugee ships, blown to smithereens and burning in the upper atmosphere. 

 Hidden amongst the Debris, a small yet fast vessel had still approached: 
[Taylor's](../taylor_cane.md) ship landed, and Georg and Horatio quickly ushered the greeting party into the ship,
where they got to witness the salting of the colony before speeding of into the vast space.

Sometime later, they landed at Enclave HQ, where Marcus immediately joined up.
